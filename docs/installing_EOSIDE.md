# Installing EOSIDE

We've tested EOSIDE on the following platforms:

- Ubuntu 18.04 (Bionic)
- MacOS 10.13 (High Sierra)
- Windows 10 (version 1803)

## Prerequisites

The only thing EOSIDE requires is [EOSFactory v3.1.0](<https://github.com/tokenika/eosfactory/releases/tag/v3.0.2>) (or higher), with its dependencies. For further information please refer to the EOSFactory [installation guide](https://eosfactory.io/build/html/tutorials/01.InstallingEOSFactory.html).

## Extension to VSC

EOSIDE is also available from the [VSC Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/vscode). There, it can be found by its name and installed onto the local system, provided EOSFactory has already been installed on your machine.

## Uninstalling

EOSIDE can be uninstalled as any other VSC extension. In the `Extensions` view select `EOSIDE`, and then click the `Uninstall` button in the EOSIDE's front page.

## Video guide

There is a short video [available](https://eosfactory.io/eoside/html/_static/installing.mp4), demonstrating the installation process.
