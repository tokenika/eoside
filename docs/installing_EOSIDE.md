# Installing *EOSIDE*

We've tested *EOSIDE* on the following platforms:

- Ubuntu 18.04 (Bionic)
- MacOS 10.13 (High Sierra)
- Windows 10 (version 1803)

## Prerequisites

EOSIDE only needs [EOSFactory](https://github.com/tokenika/eosfactory) v3.0.4 (or higher) with its dependencies, see the [installing instructions](https://eosfactory.io/build/html/tutorials/01.InstallingEOSFactory.html) for EOSFactory.

## Extension to VSCode

EOSIDE is available from VSCode Marketplace. There, it can be found by its name and installed to the local system.

If EOSFactory is in the system and it is functional then EOSIDE should start fully functional.

## Uninstalling

EOSIDE can be uninstalled as any other VSCode extension. In the *Extensions* view select *EOS IDE*, then click *Uninstall* button in the EOSIDE's front page.

## Short movie

There is [available](https://eosfactory.io/eoside/html/_static/installing.mp4) a short video, showing the process of installation.
