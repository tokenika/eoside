# EOSIDE - an Integrated Development Environment for EOSIO smart-contracts

EOSIDE organizes the workflow of development process for [EOSIO](https://eos.io/) smart-contracts. It leverages the functionality of [EOSFactory](https://eosfactory.io/). EOSIDE is implemented as a [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (VSC) extension.

EOSIDE has the following features:

- project standardization,
- easy access to project archive,
- referencing documentation and tutorials,
- automatic availability of standard libraries,
- dependency management,
- [IntelliSense](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/intellisense) code completion,
- compilation and building,
- native compilation, execution and debugging of unit tests,
- functional testing,
- deployment.
