# EOSIDE - an Integrated Development Environment for EOSIO smart-contracts

EOSIDE organizes the workflow of development process for EOSIO smart-contracts. It leverages the functionality of [EOSFactory](https://eosfactory.io/) and it's implemented as a [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (VSC) extension.

EOSIDE has the following features:

- project standardization,
- easy access to project archive,
- referencing documentation and tutorials,
- automatic availability of standard libraries,
- dependency management,
- [IntelliSense](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/intellisense) code completion,
- compilation and building,
- testing,
- deployment.

Watch a short [video]("https://eosfactory.io/eoside/html/_static/five_minutes.mp4) demonstrating EOSIDE in action. And here is another [video](https://eosfactory.io/eoside/html/_static/installing.mp4) demonstrating the setup process and a *Hello World* test.
